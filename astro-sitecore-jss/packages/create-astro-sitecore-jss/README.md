# Sitecore JavaScript Rendering Astro Initializer

It contains initializer and template for JSS sample Astro applications.

It is based on [Sitecore JavaScript Rendering SDK Initializers](https://github.com/Sitecore/jss/blob/dev/packages/create-sitecore-jss)
We used official JSS initializer as a base in order to be able to merge Astro template to the official JSS repository.

## How to use it

1. Open command line
2. Run `npx @astro-sitecore-jss/create-astro-sitecore-jss@latest`

## To Sitecore

If someone from Sitecore is reading this, please make official JSS initializer to be able to accept custom templates from URLs based on Github.
And require less parameters to be passed to the initializer. E.g. You want to implement new template, but don't have time and desire to implement code-first part.
